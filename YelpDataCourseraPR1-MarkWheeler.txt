Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (Primary)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id - foreign)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id - foreign)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id - foreign)
v.a Review = 8090 (business_id - foreign)
v.b Review = 9581 (user_id - foreign)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id - foreign)
vii. Photo = 6493 (business_id - foreign)
viii.a Tip = 3979 (user_id - foreign)
viii.b Tip = 537 (business_id - foreign)
ix. User = 10000 (Primary)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id - foreign)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id - foreign)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT * FROM user 
	where (id | name | review_count | yelping_since | useful | funny | cool | fans | average_stars | compliment_hot | compliment_more | compliment_profile | compliment_cute | compliment_list | compliment_note | compliment_plain | compliment_cool | compliment_funny | compliment_writer | compliment_photos) 
	IS NULL;

/* IS NULL can be changed to IS NOT NULL to show column content, there are some columns with zero values which I do not consider NULL. */
	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000	avg: 24.2995
		
-- SELECT min(Stars), max(Stars), avg(Stars) FROM Review; 1,5,3.7082
-- SELECT min(Stars), max(Stars), avg(Stars) FROM Business; 1,5,3.6549

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category 
by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 
stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

+-----------------------+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| name                  | city    | neighborhood           | category              | stars | hours                | review_count |
+-----------------------+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| 99 Cent Sushi         | Toronto | Downtown Core          | Restaurants           |   2.0 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |            5 |
| The Fox & Fiddle      | Toronto | Greektown              | Bars                  |   2.5 | Saturday|10:00-2:00  |           35 |
| The Gym at 99 Sudbury | Toronto |                        | Yoga                  |   3.0 | Saturday|8:00-20:00  |           14 |
| The Charlotte Room    | Toronto | Entertainment District | Venues & Event Spaces |   3.5 | Saturday|18:00-2:00  |           10 |
| Edulis                | Toronto | Niagara                | Restaurants           |   4.0 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |           89 |
| Good Gosh Beauty      | Toronto | East York              | Beauty & Spas         |   4.5 | Monday|11:30-18:00   |            6 |
| Innercity MMA         | Toronto | Chinatown              | Active Life           |   5.0 | Monday|17:00-22:00   |            3 |
+-----------------------+---------+------------------------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The two groups I chose to analyze were Bars & Restaurants. There afternoon and evening operations
were similar but not each even though the probably serve similar customers for social engagements.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
 
Yes, Bars seem to command a higher number of reviews which I found odd as I would have assumed
patrons would be more likely to comment on food verses atmosphere.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

In researching neighborhoods, it seems Greektown is near the downtown Toronto core and other listed neighborhoods.

SQL code used for analysis:

Select
b.name, b.city, b.neighborhood, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count
from (business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id) inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id
 where b.city = 'Toronto' 
 group by b.stars
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences 
can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two 
differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
+---------+---------------+---------+---------------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| is_open | name          | city    | neighborhood  | category    | stars | hours                | review_count |
+---------+---------------+---------+---------------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
|       0 | 99 Cent Sushi | Toronto | Downtown Core | Restaurants |   2.0 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |            5 |
|       1 | Edulis        | Toronto | Niagara       | Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |           89 |
+---------+---------------+---------+---------------+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+


i. Difference 1:
         
         In the example query above we first see that the review_count seems to be an indicate as to whether the Restaurants
         will have remained open or not. A high count of 89 seems to indicate that Edulis has remained open verses a low count 
         of 5 for 99 Cent Sushi indicating a possible reason for not being open.
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         In the second example from the query above we see that the star rating may indicate whether a Restaurant
         will have remained open or not. A four star rating for Edulis maybe a contributing factor to the restaurant 
         remaining open verses a low rating of two stars for 99 Cent Sushi indicating a possible reason for that firm 
         not being open.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select b.is_open, b.name, b.city, b.neighborhood, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count
from ((business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id) inner join hours h on h.business_id = c.business_id) 
 where b.city = 'Toronto' 
 group by b.is_open;
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct 
on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering 
businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to 
all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         Sentiment Analysis
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
           
           I have put together a poorman's sentiment analysis SQL code snippet. I am using the search capability 
           of the where / like clause to characterize the sentiment of the ree form text field within the review table.
           This analysis also goes by the term Bag of Words Analysis - https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-bag-of-words-algorithm.

           I chose the review table text field as it represents how one can gain untapped value in free form text entries that
           that invariably show up in almost all substantial data set.            
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+-----+-----+--------+------+-----+
|  We |   I | family | good | bad |
+-----+-----+--------+------+-----+
| 424 | 635 |     29 |  235 |  49 |
+-----+-----+--------+------+-----+
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

Select count(r.text) We, (select count(r.text) Iwords
from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
where r.text like '%I%') I, (select count(r.text) FamilyWords
from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
where r.text like '%family%') family,(select count(r.text) GoodWords
from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
where r.text like '%good%') good,(select count(r.text) Badwords
from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
where r.text like '%bad%') bad
from business b inner join review r on b.id = r.business_id
where r.text like '%we%'
